# OpenUtau_microtonal

** This project is under active development! So expect instabilities. **

This is a fork of OpenUTAU with the goal of adding support for microtonality. At the moment it has basic support for equal temperaments, only for WORLDLINE-R. It also works with VOICEVOX singers.

For more information about OpenUTAU, visit [the repository for OpenUTAU](https://github.com/stakira/OpenUtau).
For support, you can contact @takunnma on Discord. You can find him on [this server](https://discord.gg/k3Cp7kW6Jv).

## Installation

To get started, download the [latest beta release](https://github.com/takunnma5286/OpenUtau_microtonal/releases/tag/beta). You can—and should—install it alongside your existing installation of OpenUTAU. It will access the same folders and files as the existing one, so there is no need to move or copy voicebanks, phonemizers, or anything else.

If you aren't sure which one to download, here's a quick guide:

Windows: Open the downloads folder, and unzip the file you just downloaded. Run `OpenUtau.exe` in the unzipped folder.

OSX: Open the downloads folder, and open the file you just downloaded. This will install it. Then you can run it.

Linux: Open a terminal, and type `chmod +x Downloads/[file].AppImage`. Then you can close the terminal, and open it by clicking it in the Downloads folder.

## Usage

Make sure you are using WORLDLINE-R.

Set the desired number of divisions in the 'Equal Temperament (Divisions per octave)' field. (You typically do not need to change the two options below.)
